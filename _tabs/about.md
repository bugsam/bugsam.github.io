I am a security professional with a long-standing connection to computers, dating back to the 486DX era. This experience has taught me the importance of managing resources efficientlyâ€”not just in computing but also in nature.

With this blog, I aim to contribute to the community by sharing fundamental concepts of security and operating systems. My goal is to foster learning in this fascinating field through creative collaboration.
